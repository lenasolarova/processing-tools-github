# PROCESSING TOOLS

This repository and its counterpart living in GitLab contain scripts, utilities and automations used by the ObsInt processing team.

The [GitLab - processing-tools](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ccx/processing-team/processing-tools) repository is used only for scripts that need to run behind VPN - directly in GitLab - such as gathering open GitLab Merge requests. 

**You should always use this GitHub repository, unless the workload needs to be behind VPN and you ensure synchronisation with this repositry**

## Structure
- Generation and sending of test archives (local and ephemeral version)
- Open PRs for GitHub repositories action running once per day
- Open MRs for GitLab repositories commited from GitLab CICD once per day
- GlitchTip <-> Jira integration tool action running once per day (and a separate action to close issues to possibly be run manually)
